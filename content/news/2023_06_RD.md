Bionano Innovator grant is a fantastic opporunity to look at Advanced Cutaneous Lymphoma from a completely new and potentially so insightful perspective.

Thrilled and honoured to be part of the project and collaborate with Safa Najidh, Nicolas Bastidas,we aim to accomplish our best to make the most of the genomic landscape that will emerge from the Saphyr technology.
