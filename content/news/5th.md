It was a pleasure to meet today at the CNR Research Area in Pisa Dr. Toshiyasu ICHIOKA, Director of the RIKEN Europe Office.
The meeting was part of an official visit of Riken at the main CNR research areas in Italy. In Pisa Dr. Ichioka met five CNR institutes, including IITCNR. It was an interesting opportunity to present him some of our cutting-edge research activities and exchange ideas for potential collaborations between Riken and CNR.

The IIT-CNR researchers that presented their activities today, as well as our Director Marco Conti, are Chiara Boldrini, Claudio Cicconetti, Stefano Cresci, Romina D'Aurizio, Paolo Mori, Marco Pellegrini, Marinella Petrocchi and Paolo Santi, ranging from cybersecurity to decentralizedAI, moderation of online social platforms, quantum internet, urban mobility, evaluation of online content and bioinformatics.
