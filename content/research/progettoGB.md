We set up a computational pipeline based on EXCAVATOR2 for the detection of CNVs in genetics clinical practice. However at the state of the art, we are not able to identify CNVs shorter than 3 exons. Therefore we aim to exploit the distribution of the ratio between the coverage depth of one sample and the mean coverage of a pool of controls to define the prior of a Bayesian model for single-exon CNV calling.
